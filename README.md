# Simple Webshop
This is a simple frontend for a webshop, made with preact.

I used [fakestoreapi.com](https://fakestoreapi.com/) for getting product data.

## Getting Started

-   `npm run dev` - Starts a dev server at http://localhost:5173/

-   `npm run build` - Builds for production, emitting to `dist/`

-   `npm run preview` - Starts a server at http://localhost:4173/ to test production build locally
